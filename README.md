# Description
This project is a pseudo-simulation of flocking behaviour (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) implemented in Java.

I decided to make it to learn more about graphics in Java, and visual simualtions are always interesting.

# Future Improvements
- Add obstacle/wall avoidance
- Fix scaling of separation factor
- Add more interactivity such as allowing the user to add boids with their cursor, draw obstacles in real-time
